# PyTorch-Implementation-of-Group-Equivariant-CNN

This repository implements the paper [Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576). Part of the code takes references from [this repository](https://github.com/claudio-unipv/groupcnn).
This is not an efficient implementation, so modifications will be made in the future.
